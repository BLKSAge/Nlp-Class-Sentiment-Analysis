  <span class="headline">NLP and LLMs - Lab - Build a Sentiment Analyis Classifier</span>
</h1>


## About
In this lab, you will use **CountVectorizer** and **TF-IDF** in a classification model to predict customer star ratings based on their reviews of a product. (This will serve as proxy for sentiment analysis.)
1. Process review text using both CountVectorizer and TF-IDF
2. Build a logistic regression model to predict sentiment
3. Compare the performance of both approaches 

# Scenario 
You are an analyst for a marketing company that has just launched a new product suite of mobile devices. You have data from product reviews of one of these new products, the **TechWave X1**. For this lab you will use the text and star ratings from the reviews to predict customer sentiment. 

# Dataset
- The Reviews data set (`reviews.csv` in `./data/reviews.csv`) is a small sample of reviews created for this Lab
